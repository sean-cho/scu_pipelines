SCU pipelines for microarray analysis
=====================================

Pipelines for analysis of microarray and sequencing data developed jointly by SCU (Sukumar-Cope-Umbricht) labs.

```
Currently barebones, but planning to:
1. Implement as package, with accompanying shell scripts.
2. Update Readme as md, with usage instructions.
```

To do:
- [ ] Implement caching
- [ ] Complete expression pipeline
- [ ] Integrative genomics analysis functions
